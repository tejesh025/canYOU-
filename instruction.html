                <p>Display a form where the user can input their username and the number they want to guess up to.
                Add an input field for the username and another input field for the maximum number, along with a "Start Game" button.
                When the user clicks the "Start Game" button, validate the input fields to ensure they are not empty and that the maximum number is a valid number.
                If the input is valid, redirect the user to the next page (game page) with the username and maximum number as parameters in the URL.</P></div>

                <h3 id="gheading">Game Page:</h3> <hr>  
                <p> Retrieve the username and maximum number from the URL parameters.
                    Display a dialogue box or input field where the user can input their guess.
                        Add a "Check" button next to the input field.
                        When the user clicks the "Check" button, validate the input to ensure it's a valid number within the range of 1 to the maximum number.
                        Compare the user's guess with the target number (which should be randomly generated between 1 and the maximum number).
                        Display hints in a box near the input field indicating whether the user's guess was too high, too low, or correct.
                        Keep track of the number of attempts the user has made.</p>

                <p>Provide feedback to the user indicating whether they won or lost after guessing the correct number.
                    Allow the user to reset the game and play again if they wish.
                    Implement a timer to challenge users to guess the number within a certain time limit.
                    Add sound effects or animations to make the game more engaging.
                    By following these instructions, you can create a simple "Guess the Number" game with the described features. Feel free to customize the game further based on your preferences and requirements!</p>
